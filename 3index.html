    <h1 class="mb-0 my-5  mx-3">COVID-19</h1>
    <p class=" my-3 mx-3">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus.</p>
    <p class=" mx-3">The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.</p>
    <h3 class="mb-0 mx-3">How it spreads</h3>
    <p class=" my-3 mx-3">Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through contact with an infected person when they cough or sneeze. It also spreads when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it, then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.</p>
